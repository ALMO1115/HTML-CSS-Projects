NOT WORKING
	page fade in from white
	pop up form
	zoom in effect on portfolio and experience image
	auto. slideshow not scrolling through images
	how can i make "designed by audra" header a sticky element throughout the entire page?
		<div class="sitcky"></div> <!--ending div tag from sticky div tab at top of page-->
		A sticky element can only stick inside of its container, and it can only float above 
		elements also contained in that same container, i.e., siblings of the sticky element.
		-Create a sticky contact button on the bottom right of a web page.
		-Make it so that a contact form pop ups when the sticky contact button is clicked.

todo app html
	-cant get the json to js object conversion to display in html
	-cant get localstorage date to display in html


to do with Final_Portfolio_Edit
 - make sure some of the nav id names I changed sync with the CSS
 -make sure the "DESIGNED BY AUDRA" is changed from a <p> element to an header (<h1,2...>) element and refelcted within the CSS
 -check all ?'s within code to clarify what I may not understand
	is div colum1 and colun_tall best way to organize/style this?
	-check with formspree is best
 -check what the differences are between labeling left and right columns with picture and text with "Column1" and "Column2" might need to rename?
 -can get rid of the "bodylinks" class?

need to compare and possibly add to my website code
-contact form styling
-pop form styling
