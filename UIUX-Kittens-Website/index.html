            <a href="#About">About Me</a> <!--the reason this nav bar link is just "a href" whereas the above one has a class id attached to it is because the design is to have the home button have a slighty differnt look/stands out from the other nav buttons-->

When clicked on or double clicked on, this nav link will call upon the functions (openForm, meant to open up the pop form -and- closeForm, meant to close the pop form out of view)-->
