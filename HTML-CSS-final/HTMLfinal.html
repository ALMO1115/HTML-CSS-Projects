                                again. Mary Poppins take the children on many magical and memorable adventures,
                                but Jane and Michael aren't the only ones upon whom she has a profound effect. 
                                Even grown-ups can learn a lesson or two from the nanny who advises that
                                "Anything can happen if you let it."
